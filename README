Piano
=====

A funny music score translator.

Run `make' to translate sample songs.
Translated notes can be played at http://virtualpiano.net/.

Now it generates MIDI file!
Use embedded HTML5 player to play it:
Open MIDIPlayer.html or visit https://linusyang.github.io/piano/.

So no need to play by yourself :)
